Flood Forecast Final Report – April 2024
-----------------------------------------

Student: Aneeka Khan
Project: NDWI-Based Flood Forecast System

Overview:
---------
This project aims to build a data-driven flood forecasting pipeline using satellite and reanalysis data (ERA5 + GloFAS). The goal is to model the relationship between upstream activity (precipitation + temperature) and downstream discharge with a lag, simulating an NDWI-style proxy for early warning.

Data Collected:
---------------
- ERA5: Temperature, Precipitation, Runoff (April 1–21, 2024)
- GloFAS: Downstream river discharge (April 2–22, 2024)

Preprocessing:
--------------
- Extracted daily averages of upstream temperature and precipitation
- Converted discharge volumes to CSV using `xarray`
- Normalized both features and computed NDWI proxy:
    NDWI = (precip_norm - discharge_norm) / (precip_norm + discharge_norm)

Modeling:
---------
- Labeled downstream flood risk levels (low=0, medium=1, high=2)
- Aligned upstream NDWI from 3 prior weeks with target downstream flood level
- Trained a manual OLS linear regression model:
    θ = (XᵀX)⁻¹Xᵀy
- MSE on test set: 2.30

Limitations:
------------
- Small sample size (only 6 usable rows after NDWI windowing)
- Simplified NDWI proxy (no vegetation index)

Next Steps:
-----------
- Add real-time NDWI-based web input
- Improve flood labeling (calibrate thresholds)
- Visualize time series trends of NDWI and flood level

Conclusion:
-----------
This project demonstrates a complete mini-pipeline from remote sensing data to early flood prediction using basic regression techniques.
